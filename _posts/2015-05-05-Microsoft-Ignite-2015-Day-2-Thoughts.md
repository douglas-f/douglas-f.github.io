If you saw my Day 1 post you know that I was not overly excited by it. There definitely was not anything that really Ignited my passion for sure. However, Day 2 overall was a much better experience, but still not exactly what I was expecting from Microsoft’s newest conference.

The best part of the day was the Surface 3 finally became available and I was able to get my hands on one of those from the Microsoft store on the Expo floor. And even with the massive line it was a nice process. Got to chat and network with the people around me line about what they did so at the least it was some good networking.

I popped into a session on networking in Azure while I was waiting for the Expo hall to open, which by the way does not open until 10 which I think is kinda lame.

Azure has some good stuff in terms of the networking options available to you which I thought was cool and I’m not even a networking guy. They’ve got software load balancing in place. Some custom defined routes which allow you to having routing tables attached to subnets, set the default routes, tunnel traffic to appliances or on prem devices which is nice.

Speaking of appliances, they have partnered with several companies that allow you to deploy network appliances either from the Azure store or bring your own. So even if there is some requirement that certain networking appliances be used in your environment it is possible to do with Azure.

They have upgraded the number of NICs that you can assign to a Azure VM up to 16, you can mix and match the different network security groups, polices and routing rules to different NICs as well.

Using the Azure resource manager you can take pre-configured templates from Microsoft modify and deploy them as well. If you want the full details on that go to the ch9 site and search for “An Overview of Microsoft Azure Networking Capabilities” slides and video of the talk should be up a day or two from now.

The best session I went to today was about Skype for Business Room Systems. Having 8 different centers across the country and one overseas the teleconference technology that is a part of Skype for Business (Previously Lync) is an appealing technology solution. While there are other options out there I am a huge fan of having one solution rather than several different ones. I do not see the value of having technology such as Lync, Jabber, GoToMeeting, WebEx or other solutions around when I get all the functionality that my business needs out of Skype now.

In the past a lot of the hardware required for this kind of solution required a lot of time and effort from the IT staff to implement, a large chunk of cash to buy and a fair amount of training for the business users to actually use it.

However, the Skype for Business team has been working with hardware vendors in order to provide hardware solutions that work seamlessly with the Skype environment and simple enough to use that realistically the business could buy some of these devices and deploy them on their own.

According to the session speakers, based off of Microsoft research there is approximately 50 million meeting areas that do not have this kind of technology in them. And the reason simply is cost of hardware, deployment and training. Mostly the cost of hardware. It simply does not make sense for a company to spend $15,000 setting up this kind of solution in small meeting rooms.

However, with devices like the Polycom RoundTable 100, expecting to cost around $1,000 the value is much better. The users use an app on their mobile device, Windows, iOS or Android pair to the device. The device then reaches out to the cloud finds out what that users meeting info is and starts the meeting. Does not matter if the user is on prem, cloud or hybrid. It is possible to see content, see content and speaker and the best part, see ALL off the people that are a part of the meeting not just who is actively speaking.

There was additional talk of integrating this with OneDrive and Sharepoint where meeting content is automatically shared with all of the attendees and data stored for later use for all involved. I think this is really something that business with a fair amount of remote employees or offices should consider deploying in their environment.

Tomorrow I’ve got some sessions planned out that look really promising so hopefully it is a lot better than Day 1 and 2 were.
