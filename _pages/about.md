Hi, I'm Douglas. I'm a 10+ year experienced IT professional. I've spent the last several years dedicated to cloud technology, specifically working in Azure. 

I'm currently a Senior Consultant at Coalfire, helping organizations build out their FedRAMP Azure environments. A former Microsoft Premier Field Engineer for Azure, I'm always interested in digging into the power of the cloud and the flexibility that it takes. 

I'm a Microsoft Certified Trainer that loves sharing knowledge with others and empowering them with Azure and PowerShell training. I also occasionally create training videos over on TechSnips.

When I'm not in front of  a computer, I can be found making things in my shop or kayaking with my fianc√©e.
