This is my effort in putting tech info that I either found interesting or a place for me to revert to and keep track of some topics and with hopes that it may help others as well. 

I've been working in tech for almost a decade, mostly in the Microsoft space. Most of that time was spent doing traditional systems engineering with Exchange/O365, Hyper-V/SCVMM. Past few years I've been focusing on the Azure infrasturutre space. Always looking out for cool new things to do with Powershell.

By day I work as a Microsoft Premier Field Engineer at Trimax Americas. When I'm not working I can be found in the woodshop, out on my Street Glide or enjoying life with my girlfriend and our dogs.
