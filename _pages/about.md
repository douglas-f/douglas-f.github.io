I've been working in tech for almost a decade, mostly in the Microsoft space. Most of that time was spent doing traditional systems engineering with Exchange/O365, Hyper-V/SCVMM. Past few years, I've been focusing on the Azure infrastructure space and always looking out for exciting new things to do with Powershell.

By day I work as a Microsoft Premier Field Engineer at Trimax Americas. When I'm not working, I can be found in the woodshop, out on my Street Glide or enjoying life with my girlfriend and our dogs.
